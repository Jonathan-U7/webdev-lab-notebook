## Reflection Document

### HTML
I was able to complete the exercises without outside help. I think
this set of exercises sets up a good foundation in regards to the 
beginnings of html. More specifically, I believe the form would be 
the most helpful, at least within the context of this course, where
forms are used rather consistently. In regards to what could have been 
explained better, I think the relationships between calls required 
more explaination, especially considering this is the beginning of the 
term, and this concept deals with the more amount of code. I think more 
practice would be best in the form of having an entire exercise including
all of the concepts, just to get more reps under our belts. 

### Accessibility
I needed to use the solutions to help me progress in this section. I 
needed to use those because considering how new the web dev realm is
to me, it was a challenge to try and reverse engineer the code, and 
to decipher what was wrong with the code / how to fix it. It has been made 
rather clear that accessibility is very important in terms of the 
interactiveness between the user and the product. Therefore, I think
this section stands as potentially one of the most beneficial in 
knowledge. The exercises that were done in class (isolate a problemn, 
find the solution) was very beneficial, but once it came time to 
actually use them, I needed to refer back to the notes and slides. The 
depth of explanation within this topic was beneficial, mainly because 
there was a concrete reason as to why accessibility was so important
to the user's experience. Again, more time with the content would have
been the largest contributor in digesting this content more effectively. 

### CSS
I needed to use the reference on the position. I didn't recall it during 
the lecture, however, doing more research in regards to the topic, it 
become rather straightforward. The most helpful exercise would be the 
encapsulation of the selector methods. This was a good foundation to
establish in regards to learning CSS. In addition, I did like the position
exercises as well. I'm unsure if selectors require more explaination, or 
if it is an exposure issue. In essence, selectors is a simple concept that
has a large skill gap in how certain elements can be obtained and utilized. 
More exercises about selectors and pseudo would be beneficial in further
digesting this topic. 

### Flexbox
I needed to use the references for the flexbox. Even after using them, I
was still unsure about my confidence in executing this code. I understand 
why this topic has weight in terms of its importance. However, if I had more 
practice within this topic, it would be helpful to take into other realms.
Although this might entail that something would have to be better explained,
I believe it is purely the exposure that would need to increase in order 
for me to retain the information, as well as the relationships between 
varying calls for the flexbox. With that in mind, the exercises helped, 
but more exposure would be beneficial for higher levels of proficiency. 

### CSS-Grid
Of the sections so far, I believe grid takes near the top of the list in
regards to being the most enjoyable. I'm unsure what it is about grids that
I was able to understand that I couldn't grasp for flexbox, but this came 
to me more simply. It might be due to the organization of the css, where 
in many cases, it is only 2 lines that disclosed how row and columns 
needed to be spanned. Of course with more complex situations, it requires 
more code, but in essence, I believe it was the simplicity and the amount 
of power that the coder has that allowed the information to be retained. 
I don't believe much needed to be explained better in this situation, but
considering that one of the exercises contained the media queries, and that
is one that I am still wrapping my head around, made the exercise more 
difficult in that regard. I believe the complexity of the topic, as well as
the exercises and hw assignment including the grid (tv shows), those were
sufficient for practice. 

### Bootstrap
I was able to complete these exercises without using the videos. At first, 
I needed acclimation to get used to bootstrap, after getting used to it,
I understand the amount of power that it offers. Both the cards and the 
grid were the most helpful, considering that it gives us another method
to create cards or grids. This improves the flexibility when to create
a card or a grid, considering if it was to be made in html or css. In terms
of the information that was presented in class, it would be cool to see 
a single slide of a large list of class commands and what they did. Yes,
the entirity of the slides did that in detail, but a single slide as a 
refresher to what is available would be helpful as well. Considering that
we know how to do cards and grids in both css and html, it would also help 
doing bootstrap with a form. 

### Javascript
Outside of the Javascript that was used for the hw3 assignment (Ships),
it was difficult for me to digest the information within this module. I 
needed to use the videos for this module. Even after using the videos, 
I couldn't get everything to work. Even though it did not fully work for 
me, I think the functional programing section was of the most helpful, or 
most powerful. However, I think they require more explaination. Where that 
might be a fundamental problem of not understanding functional programming,
or if that is a situation where I require more exercises to display that
understanding of functional programing, these exercises were hard but 
rewarding. The exercises that were done in class to walk us through the 
functional programming were very helpful. However, I think after completing 
the exercises, required time to digest and absorb the content. If we were 
to revisit that a day later, it could reinstill the information and make 
it more concrete within my mind.
